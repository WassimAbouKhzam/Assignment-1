# Assignment-1
Create a C++ project on Visual Studio. This project should include 4 classes. The classes Animal, Dog, Cat and Fish. The Animal class should be the base class for all the others and should include two data members: Name and Age. Dog has an extra data member "Breed", Cat has "Color" and "PawSize" and Fish has "GillCapacity" and "SwimSpeed". Animal class has a virtual method print() that should print the type of the class. This virtual method should be inherited by Dog and Cat but not Fish. There should also be another virtual method that is pure that is supposed to return the owner of all the classes. All classes must have constructors and destructors (these should print that an item is created or destroyed) You don't need to create getters and setters unless you really need them. Classes should include prototype ".h" header files and definition ".cpp" files. Create a small main to create and object of each type and create 1 method to call the print method of all the class.
